# HOSDMenu installer

This is a simple application for installing the [HOSDMenu __mbr payload](../mbr/).  
Based on the [SoftDev2 installer](https://github.com/parrado/SoftDev2) by Alex Parrado.

Note that this installer doesn't set the HDD boot flags.

Requires kelftool to be present in `./kelftool/` directory
